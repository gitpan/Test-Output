Test-Output

Test-Output provides a simple interface for testing output send to STDOUT
or STDERR. A number of different utilies are included to try and be as 
flexible as possible to the tester.

To better reflect real programs, tie'ing is no longer used as a capture
method. STDOUT and/or STDERR are now redirected to handles returned by
File::Temp, which makes this module now depend upon File::Temp.  I see
no problem in doing so since File::Temp has long been part of the standard
perl distribution. And I had a look at its bug list: they are acceptable.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
